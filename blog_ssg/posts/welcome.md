I have finally created a blog for myself! I was really looking forward to do so. One of the reasons being that I really wanted to put my english writing skills to the next level. As well as because I recently got a new keyboard, and a mechanical one, and I am really enjoying to type on this thing (I pretend to make a blog post about how typing is very important for programmers). And another good reason is that when I was 10 years old, it was 2015, and everybody had a blog. I really wanted a blog too, so it was like a little dream of mine. This was also another reason for me to start learning to code when I was younger.

I plan to write about a lot of things in the future. I just have no idea what subject to talk about first lol. I am thinking about maybe writing some simple programming tutorials just like those articles I read on Medium or dev.to. As well as some walkthroughs on how I achieved something like a big project or some job opportunity.

Most of the content will probably be more technical, since I do not have that much experience to talk about more mature content like advices on getting a job (since I am unemployed lol).
