That's why you will se me writing the word &quot;video&quot; sometimes.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-use-ai/#introduction\" class=\"header-anchor\">Introduction</a></h2>\n<p>Hi, I'm John from the Pythonista channel, and this is going to be a very different video than I am used to making.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of this AI revolution, I have been very skeptical about it replacing developer jobs. But today, I see that this is not the problem yet, the main issue is how developers are using AI in their daily basis and how some companies are supporting bad practices (like google's recent firebase studio thing that is basically vibe coding).</p>\n<h2 id=\"vibe-coding-and-how-it-affects-beginners\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-use-ai/#vibe-coding-and-how-it-affects-beginners\" class=\"header-anchor\">Vibe coding and how it affects beginners</a></h2>\n<p>But what is vibe coding? So, there was this new trend, where you use AI to build apps for you and you don't even have to look at the code, you don't have to write, nor debug. Just let the AI do the job.</p>\n<p>What's the problem with this approach? Well, you simply lose the ability to think by yourself and become to dependent on AI for everything. Programming loses it's meaning. It was supposed to be a challenge, but now you let the robot do it for you.</p>\n<p>And the first threats of AI generated code have already begun to emerge.</p>\n<p>We're facing a new era of programmers who are losing the capacity of reasoning and solving problems logically. They believe that thinking is a waste of time, they use AI for everything they struggle to reason, and they call this &quot;productivity&quot;. When in reality, they are just becoming ignorant programmers.</p>\n<img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://magoninho.github.io/img/thumb.png\">\n<sup>Picture of a vibe coder (AI generated)</sup>\n<p>This, is very very bad for beginners. Listen, if you are a beginner in this field of computer science and programming, using AI is probably the worst thing you can do. It's like giving a calculator a child who is learning basic math.</p>\n<p>As Linus Torvalds once said:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>“Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” — Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux</th>\n<th><img src=\"https://cdn.facesofopensource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09202215/linus.faces22052.web_.jpg\" alt=\"linus torvalds\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<p>If you're using AI to completely do the job for you, there's no fun at all. I'm not saying you should stop using AI right now. As for the contrary, use it! I use AI everyday now, I don't even use stack overflow anymore, I even used AI to make a research for this video. We can't deny the fact that AI is a very powerful tool.</p>\n<p>The thing is, you should use it as it was intended to be used: as a <strong>copilot</strong>, but people seem to be using it as an <strong>autopilot</strong> instead. If you do so, you're just letting yourself be replaced by it, and it will become way harder to find jobs now and then. Because if you're not adding much value beyond what AI can do, then what makes you special and irreplaceable? That's what just happened when the CEO of Shopify stated that you now have to prove that your job can't be done by AI before getting hired.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/shopify-ceo-prove-ai-cant-do-jobs-before-asking-for-more-headcount.html\"><strong>Shopify CEO says staffers need to prove jobs can’t be done by AI before asking for more headcount</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using AI as a <strong>copilot</strong> means you're still in control, you're thinking and making decisions. You can let the AI help with mundane tasks, conduct effective research and help you fix bugs, which saves a lot of time that you can use to focus on solving more important problems. By doing this, you won't stop being creative, and most importantly, you'll learn much more and much faster than you would without AI. AI is meant to be your partner along the way.</p>\n<p>Now, when you use it as an <strong>autopilot</strong>, you're just outsourcing the thinking of AI and not adding effort to your job. In the end, you create an app full of security and optimization issues that you don't know how to fix, and then, you reach a point where not even AI can help you fix them.</p>\n<p>I was thinking, what a genius inventor like Leonardo DaVinci would do if he had AI tools available. So, I asked ChatGPT and it answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Leonardo da Vinci had access to AI tools like ChatGPT, he’d likely become an even more prolific innovator—using AI to iterate on his engineering designs, explore new artistic styles, accelerate language learning, and analyze scientific data far beyond his time. With tools to simulate his inventions, translate texts, and visualize complex anatomy, he could’ve leapt centuries ahead in multiple fields. He might have even used AI as a constant thought <strong>partner</strong>, helping organize his boundless curiosity into structured, actionable ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice the word <strong>&quot;partner&quot;</strong>, that's the point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-use-ai/#conclusion\" class=\"header-anchor\">Conclusion</a></h2>\n<p>So, please, use AI mindfully, as I said, use it as a partner, as a tool. Instead of asking AI to write an email for your boss, write the email first with your own words, and then ask AI to correct grammar mistakes and improve the text. Instead of asking AI to implement a full stack application for you, ask it where to start, ask it to break it down into key components and explain how they would work together, so you can implement by yourself. That will make you a better programmer and train your brain for real challenges. Stop sacrificing knowledge for speed.</p>\n<p>Do I think AI will replace programmers? I guess that's really hard to happen, since programming involves way more than just code, it's a very complex field, and we have already seen the problem of AI generated code when we saw some vibe coded apps getting hacked so easily and with a questionable quality.</p>\n<p>That's it for today guys, comment down below if you want to see more videos like this or if I should keep doing technical tutorials only.</p>\n<p>I did this video because I am out of ideas for tutorials, and I'm really out of time to code something fun.

I wanted to create a simple website to send my friends and have fun. I didn't understand nothing about programming and web development, and suddenly I was learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I never imagined that this simple decision would lead me to where I am right now. But at that time, web development was way simpler than how it is today. I could follow it very well and I was creating a lot of cool stuff. Yes, believe it or not, JavaScript was actually my first language, and I enjoyed it.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>But then, in 2018, I just stopped coding. I spent the whole year only focusing on school stuff, and completely forgot about programming in general. Then, in 2019 I was slowly coming back to code, but it was too late... Out of nothing, I was completely shocked by the popularity increase of web frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, all of that stuff. But at that time I actually didn't care about web dev anymore. I was getting into <strong>game programming</strong>.</p>\n<p>2019 was a very interesting year for me, I was really focusing on becoming a game programmer. So I started learning some game engines like Construct 2 and Unity. I did, in fact learn some new programming languages at the time, like Java, C# (for Unity) and specially Python. Overall, I had that thought because I was just a 14 year old guy that didn't know what to do in life, so I was passionate about a lot of things in the world of technology.</p>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Unity_2021.svg\" width=\"300\">\n<p>Then, 2020 came with the Covid pandemic problem. As everyone, I was at home doing nothing. Because I was bored I made a huge comeback on coding. This time I tried to learn Pygame, a simple Python module that lets people build games using Python. I have made a lot of progress not just in game development, but in my <strong>programming knowledge</strong>. I also came back to the web, doing some JavaScript game prototypes.</p>\n<p>I had so much fun doing all of that, I was really becoming a great programmer. I was doing these projects because I liked doing them. Then, I started learning C++ so I could go beyond my limits and learn to do more complex stuff just for fun. I started following youtubers like One Lone Coder, The Cherno etc. I got inspired by bad ass programmers like Notch, John Carmack. I started learning OpenGL, and made a colorful triangle with shaders!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://learnopengl.com/img/getting-started/shaders3.png\" alt=\"opengl triangle\"></p>\n<p>For many, that doesn't mean that much, but for experienced programmers, they know this is a task that not many programmers have the interest of doing. For a junior like me, it was certainly impressive. At the time, I created my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@pythonista_333\">YouTube channel</a> I even did a <a href=\"https://github.com/Magoninho/raycasting-python\">raycaster using python!</a> As well as a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E18bSJezaUE\">tutorial</a> for it on my channel!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Magoninho/raycasting-python/raw/master/demo2.gif\" alt=\"raycaster\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-real-programming-for-me\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/webdev-sucks/#what-is-real-programming-for-me\" class=\"header-anchor\">What is real programming for me</a></h2>\n<p>Can you see? All of this stuff is <strong>real programming</strong>, I was really learning about low level concepts, about computer graphics, how GPUs work, I started using linux and learned how to use the command line. Overall, my computer science basis was growing and growing. For a junior? That's impressive.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying that I was going to become the next Linus Torvalds or the next Terry Davis. Actually, the projects I did weren't that big of a deal for society at all, they didn't solve real world problems, I didn't made the next big operating system, I didn't made the next big triple A game. But, for me, the most important thing was the fact that I demonstrated a lot of interest in programming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-beginning-of-college\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/webdev-sucks/#the-beginning-of-college\" class=\"header-anchor\">The beginning of college</a></h2>\n<p>Back to my story, in 2023, I entered college, and I was crushing it, I was having such a better experience than the others, simply because I already got a decent experience. In some of my first classes we had JavaScript and Calculus, and I was enjoying it, because I already knew JavaScript and I liked math enough to also like Calculus. I even received a scholarship from a professor, just because he thought I deserved it! I felt so honored at that time.</p>\n<p>The second semester was also pretty nice, we had to use the Godot game engine, which I already knew a lot, <a href=\"https://lapadagames.itch.io/\">and I made some awesome games</a> there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-reality-shock\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/webdev-sucks/#the-reality-shock\" class=\"header-anchor\">The reality shock</a></h2>\n<p>But then, in the third semester things started to decay. It just wasn't how it was before. My scholarship ended. College was getting more expensive. I lost friends and it was my fault. The course started to get harder. And I started to worry about getting a job.</p>\n<p><strong>Then I realized that I knew basically nothing about web dev in general</strong>. I never did a simple CRUD system, I never did an online store, or even, <em>a todo list</em> (actually i made a todo list with mysql database later in the course but it was so easy to make that i didn't even care about pushing it to github).</p>\n<p>I realized that I was doomed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-development-is-boring\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/webdev-sucks/#web-development-is-boring\" class=\"header-anchor\">Web development is boring</a></h2>\n<p>Alright, it was time to start learning web development again so I could find a job. I had no choice but to switch to backend development, because frontend development is just a whole mess. As a backend developer I could choose any programming language I wanted. I mean, you can build an API with anything you want.</p>\n<p>But the problem was that I wasn't having <em>the fun</em> anymore. I wasn't excited like I was before. I started to notice that web development is not actual programming. It is just a lot of complexity that you have to deal with. But it's not a complexity that is enjoyable to explore. It's just boring asf.</p>\n<p>For me, web development is about trying to make a bunch of javascript frameworks work together and dealing with the conflicts they generate, and that's all about it. You just need to understand how things work once, and then you build a lot of projects just to get more efficient at it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1472311_YE9ME.jpg\" class=\"cover\">\n<p>I mean, these tasks are so repetitive, that AI can successfully replace a junior dev at this point. It's all about doing the same task. The only difference is the stack the company uses.</p>\n<p>Basically, you can't be a good programmer in the web development world. Because there is all this complexity you have to deal with, but it's all fake complexity. Fundamentally, how the web works is simple, but people made it harder over the years. So, all the challenges that people fight over in web development are not going to contribute to your computing knowledge.</p>\n<p>Someday, the web will collapse. It might take a few years, but at some point, it will happen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/webdev-sucks/#conclusion\" class=\"header-anchor\">Conclusion</a></h2>\n<p>I was so excited about computers and programming in the past, but now I am being forced to learn things that are just so superficial and boring that I just don't feel happy anymore. But I've got no choice, if I wanna get hired I have to learn it, because web development basically rules the job market now.</p>\n<p>Like ThePrimeGen once said in a live stream, if he could start over, he would learn web development just to get a job, but he would find time to study things that he wanted to. I feel the same way, web development became a thing that most of us need to learn just to get hired. But <strong>real programming</strong> is something we do as a side quest or maybe at an academic environment.</p>\n","date_published":"Sat, 15 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT"},{"id":"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/very-useful-guide-on-yt-dlp/","url":"https://magoninho.github.io/blog/posts/very-useful-guide-on-yt-dlp/","title":"A very useful guide on how to use yt-dlp","content_html":"<p>I've been using <code>yt-dlp</code> for a long time and it has been very useful for me in the daily basis.
